## What is the project I built 
I built a matching memory game that show a deck of 16 cards with different icons. I used the starter code _provided from Udacity_ that contains a HTML file and CSS file. I wrote my JS code in js/app.js file. 
*I made a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed.
*I built a star counter to count the number of moves that the player made.
*A timer was created to show the duration of the play.
*There is a refresh icon to restart the game. 
*I made a pop-up box to congrats the player when wins the game.


## How the game work
*Click on two cards to flip them over.
*The star move counter and timer will start counting. 
*If the two cards matched they will stay shown.
*If they didn't matched they will flipped face down .
*When all the cards are opened the player win the game and a congratulation box will pop up.
*The congratulation box will contain the number of moves and time that the player needed to win the game.
